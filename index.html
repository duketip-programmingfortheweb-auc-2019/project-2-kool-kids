  <p id="letitgo" style="background-color:#1C1C1C">  As the world progresses in time, technology is becoming less and less of a gimmick, but more of a necessity, and
    more people are required to serve those around them in these fields. In this class, we will be learning three
    different coding languages, HTML, CSS and JavaScript. We use these languages to create websites. The websites we
    create show how we have learned these languages, and we are assigned projects to keep track of our progress.
    Our instructors help us when we are behind or struggling. We don't work all day, we have two 15 minute breaks. This class teaches
    us skills that will change our lives.

        <h2>First Week</h2>
        <p>The very first week was the base foundation for us learning how to code websites in a fun and formal way,
          resulting in amazing, professional websites. We went over HTML and CSS, mastering the basics of both. At the
          end
          of the week, we did a solo project to see how much we knew.</p>

        <h2>Second Week</h2>
        <p>As the second week starts, we are finishing our first group projects. Then, we will learn web design and
          aesthetics, followed by Javascript fundamentals, along with its uses and implementation. As the week comes to
          a
          close, we will be learning how to use JQuery.

        <h2>Third Week</h2>
        <p>Starting off the third week, we'll be finishing off JQuery and learing what an API is. But on Tuesday, we'll
          be
          doing our final project, a true test to see how much we've learned over the past few weeks. After this, we
          gradulate, knowing 3 different coding languages. What most would learn in months, we learned in weeks.</p>

      is from 9:00 am to 4:00 on weekdays. After class, we have an evening study from 6:00 pm to 7:00 pm.

    <h2 id="highlights">Highlights</h2>
    <p class="fontstyle" id="ihadnochoice">While we do get work done, sometimes we can have a laugh every once in a
      while. The earliest example of this was the age old question: "Can you put a button inside of a button!?!?!?!?"
      Somebody asked this, and after a bit of struggling, we managed to make a table act as a button, and put a button
      inside of the table as well. It soon became a recurring joke, whenever a TA
      would ask if there were any questions, somebody would say, "Could you put it inside a button?" which got everyone
      to laugh. Another one was Student #9, our arguably most famous gag. Before
      we arrived, there was supposed to be a ninth student. However, he or she never showed up. But whenever we made our
      Git-Hub classroom, there were 9 people who clicked on the link! We all joked
      it was student #9, and it got so funny that we put it on our t-shirt. Our final joke happened when we were
      introduced to Bootstrap. We saw the loading spinners and got some ideas. 1 person made
      a website with 6 million spinners, and another person made a bunch of spinners inside each other and made an
      optical illusion.</p>
